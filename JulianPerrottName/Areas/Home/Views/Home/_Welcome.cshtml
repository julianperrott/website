            Welcome to my personal site.
            <br /><br />
            I've been coding for most of my life, it's the strange mixture of creative, scientific and constant change which never gets old. 
            <br /><br />
            Here on this site you will find examples of me experimenting with different web,server and database technologies, to try and both understand them and showcase their possibilities. Take a look at my blog and the
            projects below to see what I am having fun with.
