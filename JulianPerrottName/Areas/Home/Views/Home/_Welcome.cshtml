            Welcome to my personal site.
            <br /><br />
            I began coding while at school and all these years later I still play with code when not at work.
            <br /><br />
            Here on this site you will find examples of me experimenting with different web technologies, to try and both understand them and showcase their possibilties. Take a look at my blog and the
            projects below to see what I am having fun with.
            <br /><br />
